# AWS-Security
This repository contains Terraform configuration files for setting up a basic AWS infrastructure. As a DevOps engineer, I created this project to allow the migration of on-premises applications to AWS, focusing on establishing a highly secure setup, designed to protect and manage cloud-based applications effectively.
